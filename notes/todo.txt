TODO:
Clean up LogToGUI
  Make a LogToRenderConsole and LogToGUI instead

BUGS:
Try Reconnect if Server is closed and reopened (sends after server close just fail)
  (try reconnect if send fails, then resend)

File Logger adds the string "\n", don't manually add that for file or console logging.
  Should only be there for Socket logging

FINISHED:
handle log attempt after socket close.
  Maybe use atexit: https://docs.python.org/2/library/atexit.html
