TODO:
Clean up LogToGUI (server side)
  Make a LogToRenderConsole and LogToGUI instead

KNOWN BUGS:


FINISHED:
handle log attempt after socket close.
  Maybe use atexit: https://docs.python.org/2/library/atexit.html
  https://docs.python.org/2/library/atexit.html

Try Reconnect if Server is closed and reopened (sends after server close just fail)
(try reconnect if send fails, then resend)

File Logger adds the string "\n", don't manually add that for file or console logging.
  Should only be there for Socket logging
